# landing-page

This website is my second website troughout my journey in web development. Building this website proves the use of HTML and CSS elements: primarily flexbox and laying out html elements and div blocks all around the page, in addition to manipulating commands such as: padding, margin and other positioning instructions. \
The subject of this website is urban decay. The themes i used for this website are dark and unwelcoming, having used a lot of dark greys and such.
